# What is EnCam


EnCam stands for ENcrypted CAMera. The EnCam project aims at creating a Camera App for Android 
that stores pictures in a (more) secure way. To achieve this goal, the pictures are encrypted 
using APG, a free OpenPGP implementation for Android, before they are written to the storage medium.
