The pictures are encrypted on the fly and saved in a folder on the storage medium you can define in &lt;i>Preferences&lt;/i>. The default folder is &lt;i>Encrypted Pictures&lt;/i>. The filename is generated randomly, the suffix is always &lt;i>.ejpg&lt;/i>.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;big>Decrypt photos&lt;/big>&lt;br />The encrypted photographs are stored in the described folder on the SD-Card. They can be copied to any computer and decrypted using gpg.&lt;br />You should store the decrypted pictures only on secured media, like an encrypted drive.</string>
